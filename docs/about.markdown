Ever since I was a kid, I've been in love with the outdoors. I grew up hiking in south-east Queensland, Australia, covering boots with dust and miles; finding mushrooms and IDing birds in the garden; watching David Attenborough and falling in love with the diversity of life on this planet. It made studying ecology and evolution an easy choice.

My research interests primarily lie in the application of population genetic and genomic approaches to understanding the eco-evolutionary biology of wild populations - currently, my PhD research is focused on the genomics of inbreeding depression and population decline in a long-term study of superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus. I have previously worked across many different systems, including intertidal fish, weed species such as rubbervine and parthenium, and monitoring of pest and native animals at Bush Heritage Australia's Carnarvon Station; I am more motivated by approaches than by a particular study system. It's hard to choose!

I also love sharing the wonder of science and biodiversity, and have been fortunate to be involved in developing and delivering ecology, statistics and genetic workshops for both high school teachers and students. See the Outreach and Science Communication page for more of this!
