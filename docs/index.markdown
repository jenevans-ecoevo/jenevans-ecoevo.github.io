### Eco-evolutionary biology and conservation genomics
**PhD Candidate, Australian National University**

**Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours - Class I), University of Queensland**

My research interests primarily lie in the application of population and quantitative genomic approaches to understanding the eco-evolutionary biology of wild populations, particularly in conservation or applied contexts. 

My PhD research is currently focused on the genomics of inbreeding depression and population decline in a long-term study of superb fairy-wrens, *Malurus cyaneus*. In the thirty years since the study was first founded, the population has nearly halved, alongside a decline in the number of breeding pairs. I will be testing several explanations for the decline, including inbreeding depression, parasitism and various eco-evolutionary dynamics.
