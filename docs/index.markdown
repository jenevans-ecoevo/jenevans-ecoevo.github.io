### Eco-evolutionary biologist
**Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours - Class I), University of Queensland**
**PhD Candidate, Australian National University**

My research uses quantitative and population genomics to better understand population dynamics and ecological interactions, underlying conservation issues and population declines. 

Currently, I am undertaking my PhD at the Australian National University, studying a long-term study of superb fairy-wrens, *Malurus cyaneus*. The population has more than halved in the thirty years since the study began. In my PhD project, I will combine ecological and genomic data to test several key processes contributing to the severe decline of the population, including inbreeding depression, blood parasitism and other evolutionary dynamics.
