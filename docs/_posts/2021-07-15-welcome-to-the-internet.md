This has certainly been a rollercoaster - I've never used GitHub before, let alone tried to set up a GitHub page with Jekyll and themes! I think I'm almost done now, though I don't doubt that I will be continuing to tweak and update this site as I get more used to the system for adding and editing content. 

Some of the lessons I learnt along the way:
- GitHub's [tutorial for setting up a Jekyll page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) really is invaluable
- It is also worth finding a [theme](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) you like early and making sure you read the documentation for how to set up theme-specific repository structures. Stick to it once you've chosen!
- If you haven't used GitHub before, definitely take the basic beginner tutorial and build a hello-world repository. The terminology and structures that GitHub uses will make a lot more sense. 


The question remains exactly what one should include in a website. Any thoughts are welcome - what would you include in a personal website like this?
