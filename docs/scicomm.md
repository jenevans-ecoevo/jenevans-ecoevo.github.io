Sharing the wonder of science is one of my favourite things about being a scientist. From ecology, to marine science, zoology, and statistics - from creating video resources for high school teachers, to creating online workshop content in the COVID-19 pandemic, and running in-person workshops and presentations - from working with teachers to develop professional development resources, to hosting seminars and volunteering at the World Science Festival. 

A large part of my science outreach and communication experience has been through working with the Faculty of Science at the University of Queensland, where I have had the opportunity to develop, create and teach into several different types of workshops and events. That experience has been invaluable, and is primarily thanks to Dr Gurion Ang from UQ's School of Biological Sciences, and the fantastic network of tutors and teachers he has connected. 

I'm continuing to pursure my passion for teaching science and inspiring future scientists, and am available for media or other opportunities.
