This one-day workshop introduces Year 11 students to the world of ecology, experimental design and statistics. 

Packaged as a one-day, on-campus event, we deliver interactive workshop modules 'in the field' around the beautiful UQ Lakes - measuring insect diversity, running vegetation transects, and discussing how to best approach ecological data collection. This comprehensively prepares students to undertake their on extended experiments as part of their senior assessment in the Queensland curriculum. 

Across the Experience Ecology workshops held in 2019 and 2020, we reached more than 7000 secondary students across over 120 Queensland schools both in the metro and regional areas.
