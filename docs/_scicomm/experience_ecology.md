Experience Ecology introduces Year 11 students to the world of ecology, experimental design and statistics. Packaged as a one-day, on-campus event, we delivered interactive workshop modules 'in the field' around the beautiful UQ Lakes - measuring insect diversity, running vegetation transects, and discussing how to best approach ecological data collection. 

I assisted in tutoring and running this event in both 2019 and 2020. Combined, we reached over 7000 secondary students across over 120 Queensland schools both in the metro and regional areas.
