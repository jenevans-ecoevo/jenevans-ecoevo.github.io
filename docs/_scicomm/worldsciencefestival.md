The Festival is held annually in Brisbane, and shares the full spectrum of science with the public. 

I volunteered as a volunteer supervisor at the event in both 2018 and 2019, helping manage volunteer teams and events at the Southbank Cultural precinct and the Queensland Museum. 
The Festival is a wonderful opportunity to meet other like-minded volunteers from all walks of life, with a shared passion for science and community outreach.
